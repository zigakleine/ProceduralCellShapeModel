# ProceduralCellShapeModel
Procedural modelling of cell shape can be a useful tool assisting the complicated process of medical image segmentation. For this seminal work, we followed a commonly used technique of procedural modelling using a point distribution model. It was implemented as the seminal work for the Advanced computer graphic course.
